/*
   A median filter object is created by by passing the desired filter window size on object creation.
   The window size should be an odd number between 3 and 255.

   New data is added to the median filter by passing the data through the in() function.  The new medial value is returned.
   The new data will over-write the oldest data point, then be shifted in the array to place it in the correct location.

   The current median value is returned by the out() function for situations where the result is desired without passing in new data.

   !!! All data must be type INT.  !!!
